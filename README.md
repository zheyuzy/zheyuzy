# Lim Zhe Yee (Zhe Yee)

Financial Engineering + Applied ML. I build fast, pragmatic systems that turn complex market data into clear decisions.

- MScFE @ WorldQuant University · BEng EEE @ NTU
- Quant research: volatility forecasting, risk modeling, and ML-driven strategies
- Full‑stack: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, SQL, React, Node

## Selected Work

### GARCH‑LSTM for ETH/BTC Volatility & Strategy
Hybrid model combining `{latex}\text{GARCH}` dynamics with `{latex}\text{LSTM}` for temporal features; evaluated on ETH/BTC with walk‑forward backtesting. Results show improved stability vs. baselines under regime shifts.
- Repo: GARCH-LSTM-model-on-ETH-BTC-pair
- Highlights: architecture, ablation, risk metrics (Sharpe, max drawdown), transaction cost robustness
- Tech: Python, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

### Menutify (Spotify Top Tracks “Menu”)
React app + Node backend generating a menu-themed image from Spotify top tracks/artists across time ranges.
- Live: Vercel deployment
- Tech: React, Express, Spotify API

### HKN (Hacker News Clone)
Modern minimal HN client with fast load and clean UX.
- Tech: TypeScript, React

### DumbAIss (macOS AI Compare)
Native macOS app to compare AI responses side‑by‑side without API keys.
- Tech: Swift

## What I’m focused on
- Robust time‑series models for volatile markets
- Efficient backtesting and data pipelines
- Production‑grade ML + intuitive UIs
